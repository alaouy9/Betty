This document describes the C coding style for Holberton School.
Coding style is very personal, and we won't force our views on anybody.
But we expect you to follow this coding style for all the projects related to Holberton School. The Holberton School coding style is mainly inspired by the Linux Kernel coding style, but it's slightly modified.
To avoid any confusion, please refer to this guide and not the official Linux Kernel coding style.
